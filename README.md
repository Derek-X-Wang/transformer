# What is transformer

**"If you know A, let's learn B."**

As a developer, you often need to pick up a new language/framework/platform. You are not a "Beginner". You just have knowledge in different domain. This project aims to link different knowledge domains and give you a jump-start on the new things. By, summing up the similarities and differences of languages/frameworks/platforms.

In short,

**"XXX tutorial for YYY developers."**



I like to try new things, but it often takes more time than it should. I want this kind tutorial so badly and that's why I make it.

This is a big goal. Any help is welcomed!
